# fubs-os
My own Universal Blue image, based on Universal Blue's [aurora](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora), with some modifications:
- most packages from Aurora-DX but
  - no Visual Studio Code
  - no Docker runtime
  - no Incus
- Pre-release version of OpenConnect (with fix to connection issues with our VPN).

# Image
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/mafuba8/fubs-os
```
